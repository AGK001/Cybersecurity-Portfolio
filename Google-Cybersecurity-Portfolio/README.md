## 📁 Portfolio Activities & Projects

### 🛡️ Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
* **[Analyze a Vulnerable System for a Small Business](./E-commerce-Vulnerability-Assessment)**: Conducted a vulnerability assessment using NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 to identify risks for a publicly accessible database.
* **[Conduct a Security Audit](./Security-Audit-Botium-Toys)**: Evaluated organizational security controls, identified gaps, and recommended compliance strategies.
* **[Use the NIST CSF to Respond to a Security Incident](./NIST-Incident-Response-DDoS)**: Applied the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) to manage a simulated security breach.

### 🔍 Technical Security Operations
* **[Apply Filters to SQL Queries](./SQL-Security-Filters)**: Used SQL to query databases, filter for specific security events, and audit user access logs.
* **[Use Linux Commands to Manage File Permissions](./Linux-Permissions)**: Leveraged the Linux CLI (`chmod`, `chown`) to implement the Principle of Least Privilege on system files.
* **[Incident Handler's Journal](./Incident-Journal)**: A detailed log of security incidents, analysis steps, and remediation actions taken during simulated SOC tasks.

### 🐍 Security Automation
* **[Update a File Through a Python Algorithm](./Python-Automation)**: Developed a Python script to automate the updating of "allow lists" for IP addresses, demonstrating intermediate scripting skills for security tasks.

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes
Through these activities, I have gained practical experience in identifying threats from human and technological sources , assessing threat events like data exfiltration , and determining the likelihood and severity of risks to business operations.
