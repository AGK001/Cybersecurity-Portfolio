# 🛡️ Project: Vulnerability Assessment & Risk Analysis
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1  
**Focus:** Attack Surface Reduction & Data Security

## 📝 Executive Summary
 This project involved conducting a comprehensive vulnerability assessment for an e-commerce organization to address a critical security flaw: a publicly accessible remote database server. Using the **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1** guidance, I identified, analyzed, and prioritized risks to help decision-makers allocate resources and implement effective security controls.

## 🏗️ System Description
The assessment focused on a remote database server critical for identifying customers and supporting global e-commerce operations.
* **Operating System:** Linux.
* **Database Management:** MySQL.
* **Hardware:** High-performance CPU with 128GB RAM.
* **Existing Security:** SSL/TLS encrypted connections.
* **Primary Vulnerability:** Publicly accessible database port (exposed to the internet for 3 years)

## 🔍 Risk Assessment Matrix
Using NIST SP 800-30 definitions for Threat Sources (human, technological, and environmental entities) and Threat Events (exploits causing harm), I calculated risk scores based on Likelihood and Severity.

| Threat Source | Threat Event | Likelihood (1-3) | Severity (1-3) | Risk Score (LxS) |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Human (External Hacker)** | Data Exfiltration (Sensitive Info) | 3 | 3 | **9 (Critical)** |
| **Technological (Malicious Malware)** | Alteration/Deletion of Critical Data | 2 | 3 | **6 (High)** |
| **Human (Competitor)** | Reconnaissance & Surveillance | 3 | 1 | **3 (Low)** |

## 🛡️ Remediation & Defense-in-Depth Strategy
To mitigate these risks and comply with regulations like **GDPR/CCPA**, I recommended a multi-layered security approach:

* **Network Hardening:** Immediate removal of public access. Implementation of network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict traffic to authorized internal networks only.
* **Secure Access:** Mandatory **Company VPN** for remote employees combined with **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
* **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** Enforced **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** following the **Principle of Least Privilege**.
* **Data Security:** Implementation of encryption for sensitive data at rest to prevent unauthorized access in the event of a breach.
* **Continuous Monitoring:** Established regular log auditing, vulnerability scanning, and periodic penetration testing.

## 💡 Key Skills Demonstrated
* **Risk Management:** Applied NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 to identify and prioritize business threats.
* **Security Auditing:** Evaluated system configurations against security best practices.
* **Technical Writing:** Translated technical vulnerabilities into actionable business risk reports for stakeholders.
* **Regulatory Knowledge:** Addressed data protection requirements for global e-commerce operations.
