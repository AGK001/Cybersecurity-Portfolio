# 📓 Project: Incident Handler's Journal

**Role:** Cybersecurity Analyst  
**Focus:** Incident Documentation, Phishing, DDoS, & Brute-Force Analysis                      
**Framework:** NIST Incident Response Lifecycle

## 📝 Executive Summary
The Incident Handler's Journal is a professional record of security events identified and analyzed during the Google Cybersecurity program. It documents the end-to-end lifecycle of three major security breaches: a ransomware attack, a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) event, and a persistent brute-force campaign. This project demonstrates my proficiency in using standardized templates and playbooks to maintain an audit trail - a critical requirement for SOC operations and forensic investigations.

## 🏗️ The Journaling Process
Every entry in this journal follows the **5 W's** (Who, What, When, Where, Why) to ensure comprehensive situational awareness:
1. **Discovery:** Identifying the initial attack vector (e.g., phishing attachments).
2. **Technical Analysis:** Using tools like **Suricata (IDS)** and **Splunk (SIEM)** to analyze network traffic and logs.
3. **Remediation:** Implementing firewall rules, IP filtering, and encryption.
4. **Reflections:** Documenting "Lessons Learned" to strengthen future security posture.

## 🔍 Featured Incident Logs

### 1. Ransomware Attack (Healthcare Sector)
* **Scenario:** An organized group deployed ransomware via a phishing email at a U.S. healthcare clinic.
* **Impact:** Critical patient files were encrypted, disrupting healthcare operations.
* **Key Insight:** Highlighted the urgent need for email filters, regular backups, and employee security awareness training.

### 2. ICMP Flood (DDoS) Response
* **Scenario:** A two-hour DDoS attack traced to an unconfigured firewall.
* **Impact:** Internal network services were rendered unresponsive.
* **Remediation:** Applied the NIST CSF to implement ICMP rate-limiting and source IP verification.

### 3. Mail Server Brute-Force Investigation
* **Scenario:** Persistent login attempts identified around the same time each day targeting a mail server.
* **Tools Used:** Analyzed authentication logs and network traffic.
* **Remediation:** Recommended strict firewall rules to restrict mail server access to authorized IP addresses only.

## 💡 Key Skills Demonstrated
* **Tool Proficiency:** Practical experience with **Suricata (IDS)** for traffic analysis and **Splunk (SIEM)** for log management.
* **Documentation & GRC:** Mastery of incident logging templates and playbooks to ensure organizational compliance.
* **Threat Analysis:** Ability to differentiate between attack types (Phishing vs. DDoS vs. Brute-Force).
* **Framework Mastery:** Applying the **NIST Incident Response Lifecycle** (Detection & Analysis through Post-Incident Activity).
